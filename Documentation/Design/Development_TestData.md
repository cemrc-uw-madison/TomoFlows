## Location for testing data
Since test images will be too large to be pushed onto github, I \
think we can store them on some server and get it via url  
so that we can use shell script to automatically download them.

## Test data inputs

## task_gain.py
- Gatan DM4 superresolution gain image (.dm4)
- MRC gains
- EER or tiff gains
- Outputs, like a converted dm4 -> mrc output.
