## Team Style

Naming for files, classes, methods, and variables - we will adopt the Google Python Style conventions [Google Python Conventions](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#3164-guidelines-derived-from-guidos-recommendations).

## Task and Unit Tests

All "tasks" will match a Python interface, and have concrete implementation classes.

### Test data

Do not put binary data, images or other test data directly in the GitHub repository.  We will have a distribution method to host these files online and share as an archive that can be used for running the unit tests or active development.
